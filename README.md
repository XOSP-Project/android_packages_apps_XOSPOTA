#XOSPOTA
-------
A simple OTA Checking made for XOSP ROM

##How it works
------------
It parses the OTA xml file that is found in the xosp_ota repo and compares the version number with the local one.
If the version is newer, it will notify the user for a new ROM update.

##Official
------------
The XOSPOTA App will be built only for the officially supported devices by the XOSP Team, so every device which is not on our list will be took as an unofficial one and the app will not be compiled, so don't worry if you're not seeing it in Settings
